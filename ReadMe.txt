System requirements:
This software was made and tested on a desktop computer (Mac OS) running Matlab 2019+

Installation guide:
Just go the main folder in Matlab and run the tda_msc_rsfmri_runmapper.m file to run Mapper on the data and tda_msc_rsfmri_anamapper.m to generate results in the manuscript

Demo:
Within tda_msc_rsfmri_anamapper.m file, each cell can be independently run to generate individual figures

Instruction for use:
You can individually run each cell in the Matlab file tda_msc_rsfmri_anamapper.m

The data can be downloaded from individual data websites as mentioned in the paper.
